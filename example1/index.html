<!-- Any text inside these kinds of tags is treated as a 'comment'.
Comments are ignored by the browser and will not be displayed on your website.

They have two main uses:

1. use comments to explain what some code does, this can be useful to you if you come back to some
code after a long time and forgot why you wrote it in the first place.

2. you can 'comment out' code if you want to test what your website will look like without a specific line of html. This is more convenient than just deleting the line. Just surround the html
you want to hide with the comment tags. -->

<!-- These are headings in descending order of size -->
<!-- try 'commenting out' the h1 line below and refresh your browser. -->
<h1>Size 1</h1>
<h2>Size 2</h2>
<h3>Size 3</h3>
<h4>Size 4</h4>
<h5>Size 5</h5>
<h6>Size 6</h6>

<!-- A paragraph groups text together and creates space around it -->
<p>
  This is a paragraph. Here is some <strong>bold</strong> text.

  Here is some <em>italic</em> text.

  I'll <u>underline</u> this.

  Notice how these sentences were all on separate lines in the text editor but don't show like that in the browser?

  That's because html doesn't take into account extra white       space     between
               words.
  <br>
  To go to the next line you can use the br tag or just make a new paragraph.
</p>

<p>This is a new paragraph.</p>

  <!-- a hyperlink is created using the anchor ('a') tag.
       href is the external website or page in your website that you are linking to.
       target is an optional attribute and the value '_blank' ensures the link opens in a new tab.
       The bit between <a> and </a> will be the clickable part of the link - this can be text
       or even an image.
 -->
  A link to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk" target="_blank">BBC</a> website.

<!-- An unordered list, the list items will be bullet points
     Take care that all tags are nested correctly.

  <!-- Each item in the list must be inside an <li> tag -->
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>

<!-- img is a self closing tag, i.e. it doesn't require a separate closing tag.
     src is the location of the image, either a file in your website directory or a
     link to an image online.
     alt is the alternative text that will appear in case the image fails to load - this is usually
     because the filename is misspelled, the location of the file is incorrect, or the file
     doesn't exist. you can test that out by misspelling the filename or just delete the src attribute.
 -->
<img src="images/cat.jpg" alt="A cat">

<!-- this is a line break. can be used to make sure that the next element is below the previous
     element.
     Comment out this tag and see what happens to the position of the button below.
     This is also a self closing tag.
-->
<br>

<!-- this button doesn't do anything but with javascript it can be programmed to do anything.
     the text inside the button tag is the text that will appear on the button.
 -->
<button>Click me - nothing happens :-(</button>

<!-- horizontal rule creates a straight horizontal line across the page.
     This is also a self closing tag.

<!-- table has a thead tag and a tbody tag.
     thead contains the column headers. Each header is inside a th tag.
     tbody contains the rows. Each row is created by using a tr tag.
     Each tr will have x td tags, where x is the number of th tags. (3 in the example below).
     If a particular cell is meant to be empty, then leave it as just <td></td>  Do not omit
     this otherwise your table will look wrong. Try commenting out one of the lines containing
     an age and see how this effects the table. Then try replacing that line with '<td></td>'
     and notice the difference.
     Take care that all tags are nested correctly.
