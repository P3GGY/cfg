<h1>Page 2</h1>

<p>This is a new page which opened up in the same tab on your browser.</p>

<!-- divs are divisions, or sections in your page.
     By adding a 'style' attribute we can apply css to this specific element.
 -->
<div style="border: 1px solid red">
  <p>
    Div tags are used to create sections (or <strong>div</strong>isions) on your web pages. It is one of the most important elements but its benefits won't become apparent until we look at CSS.
    I used 'inline css' to show how we can put a red border around this whole div.
    Change the word 'red' to 'blue' and notice the difference. Also trying changing 1 to 10 to
    see how this effects the thickness of the border. And finally try changing 'solid' to 'dashed'.

  <p>
    This is a new paragraph but it's part of the same 'div' as the previous paragraph.

<!-- notice how the line below has 3 different tags, and notice how they are nested.
     The first tag to be opened ('p') is the last one to be closed. And the last one to be
     opened ('strong') is the first one to be closed.
