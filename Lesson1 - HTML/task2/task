You're going to make a personal website, kind of like a cv/portfolio website.

1) Make a html document that has your full name as the page title (i.e. the title shown in the browser tab, not on your actual webpage)

2) add a heading of the largest size which says "welcome to my site"

3) add a horizontal line just after the heading

4) add a paragraph to describe yourself, say who you are, what you do, and what your career or life objectives are.

5) add a face photo

6) add a link which redirects to your github/linkedin/facebook account (or add a link for each of them). The link should open up in a new tab.

7) using bullet points, list 3 of your characteristics

8) add a table which highlights some of your best grades, you can have module and grade as column headings. or maybe a table to show some skills or languages (computer/human) you know, along with your skill level. Or even a table of your hobbies.

9) add a button at the bottom of the page which says "Contact me". The button doesn't need to function as we haven't looked at javascript yet.

10) make sure all files and directories are named according to the correct standards and conventions

Don't worry about how it looks as we'll be looking at css in the next lesson, but try and keep it so each element is below the previous one.

Have fun and let us know if you have any questions!
