    <!-- Linking to an external css file is the best way to style your html.
    You can link to multiple stylesheets, just add one of these link tags
    for each stylesheet. -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">

    <!-- This is another way of adding CSS to a HTML document. It follows the same syntax
    as the css in an external file, but the rules are placed inside style tags, which is inside
    the head tag. There should be no more than one style tag per html document. It is better to
    avoid writing css inside a html document. Try to only use external css files. -->
    <style>
      h1 {
        /* When choosing a colour you can use names like "blue", "aqua" or even "darksalmon".
        Find a list of all colour names at: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp */

    <!-- Inline CSS should be avoided where possible but here is an example
    of how it can be used to apply styles to a specific element. Inline css rules
    only effect that specific element, no other element will be effected.
    Also notice that there are contradicting rules for the h1 color in the head tag
    above as well as in the external css file, but it is this css rule below that is applied. -->

    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It adds style to your HTML.</p>

    <h2>How to add CSS</h2>
    <p>There are three ways to add CSS to a HTML document:</p>
    <!-- multiple inline styles are separated by a semi-colon -->
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman; border: 1px solid green;">
      <li>Inline</li>
      <li>Inside the head tag</li>
      <li>External CSS file</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Anatomy of a CSS rule set</h2>
    <p>CSS rules follow a specific syntax, as shown in the <strong>image</strong> below:</p>
    <img src="images/css_rule.png" alt="CSS Syntax">

    <h2>Examples of CSS properties</h2>
    <p>Here are some examples of different types of properties you can style:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>color</li>
      <li>background-color</li>
      <li>font-family</li>
      <li>font-size</li>
      <li>text-align</li>
      <li>border</li>
      <li>padding</li>
      <li>margin</li>
      <li>width</li>
      <li>height</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please research all the above properties to have an idea of what they do and how they
      should be implemented. You can read more about them and many other properties <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
